                The first VR headset was patented in the 1960's and was named the 'Telesphere Mask' by inventor Morton Heilig. You can also read more about Heilig's "telescopic television apparatus for individual use" on techradar. Using VR head mounted displays, such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Sony PlayStation glasses, users find themselves in a 360° video or computer-generated world. The digital space fully replaces your real-world environment. VR takes also full advantage of body- and motion-tracking capabilities, with many arguing that this leads to a greater sense of presence and immersion. Combined with headphones and special audio as well as touch-sensitive haptic controllers you are able to interact with virtual objects and immerse all senses in its environment, including smell with Bluetooth beacons.

                The use of the term “virtual reality,” however, was first used in the mid-1980s when Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research, began to develop the gear, including goggles and gloves, needed to experience what he called “virtual reality.” Even before that, however, technologists were developing simulated environments.VR isn't all fun and games - the technology is now being used in healthcare to treat depression, anxiety and PTSD amongst other things. Versatile stuff! Read this article Virtual Reality May Boost Empathy More Than Other Media on Imagination Matters for more interesting applications.No single person invented virtual reality. Instead, many people have contributed to the technology's growth. Some of the names include Morton Heilig, Jaron Lanier, Douglas Engelbert, Ivan Sutherland and Myron Kreuger. Collaboration, prototyping and iteration have gone into the development of this versatile technology and those are skills we think it's fundamental to give people the chance to develop through their lives.
